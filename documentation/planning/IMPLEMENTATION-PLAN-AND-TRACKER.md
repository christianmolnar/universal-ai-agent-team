## **CURRENT STATUS DASHBOARD**

### **📊 Overall Progress**
| Phase | Target Days | Status | Completion |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | 3-4 days | 🟡 READY | 0% |
| **Phase 2** | 2-3 days | ⏸️ BLOCKED | 0% |  
| **Phase 3** | 4-5 days | ⏸️ BLOCKED | 0% |
| **Phase 4** | 6-8 days | ⏸️ BLOCKED | 0% |
| **Phase 5** | 3-4 days | ⏸️ BLOCKED | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **18-24 days** | 🟡 FOUNDATION | **0%** |

### **🚨 Critical Path Dependencies**
1. **Phase 1 MUST complete first** - All other phases depend on systematic scoring
2. **Link validation (Phase 2)** required before real estate analysis
3. **No parallel development** until Phase 1 proves quality gates work

### **⚡ 160x Efficiency Multiplier Applied**
- **Standard Development:** 18-24 days → **2,880-3,840 hours**
- **AI-Assisted Development:** 2,880-3,840 hours ÷ 160 = **18-24 hours actual work**
- **Calendar Time:** 3-4 weeks (accounting for iteration, testing, refinement)
