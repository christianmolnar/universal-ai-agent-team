# Real Estate Analysis Methodology
**Universal Methodology for ALL Real Estate Transactions**

**Last Updated**: December 26, 2025  
**Status**: Active methodology - applies to all real estate projects

---

## 🎯 UNIVERSAL BUDGET PRINCIPLE

**CRITICAL RULE**: When a budget amount is specified (e.g., $696K), that amount covers **ALL transaction costs**:
- Closing costs
- Lender fees
- Title insurance
- Inspections
- AND downpayment

**Calculation Order**:
1. Estimate closing costs (~1-2% of purchase price)
2. Net Downpayment = Budget - Closing Costs
3. Mortgage = Purchase Price - Net Downpayment
4. Calculate monthly payment on NET mortgage amount

**This methodology applies to EVERY real estate purchase, not just this Arizona move.**

## 🏠 PRIMARY RESIDENCE ANALYSIS

### Financial Analysis Rules

**CRITICAL**: Always use the EXACT downpayment amount specified by user. Do NOT calculate alternative percentages.

#### Given Information:
- **Ravensdale Sale Proceeds**: $696,000 (conservative estimate)
- **Budget Strategy**: $696K covers ALL transaction costs (closing + downpayment)
- **Interest Rate**: 7% (current market rate)
- **Loan Term**: 30 years fixed

#### Calculation Steps:

1. **Estimate Closing Costs**:
   ```
   Closing Costs = ~1-2% of purchase price
   Typically $12,000-$15,000 for properties in $1.2-1.5M range
   ```

2. **Calculate Net Downpayment**:
   ```
   Net Downpayment = $696,000 - Closing Costs
   ```

3. **Calculate Mortgage Amount**:
   ```
   Mortgage = List Price - Net Downpayment
   ```

4. **Monthly Principal & Interest (P&I)**:
   ```
   Use 7% interest rate, 30-year term
   Calculate on the MORTGAGE amount (after closing costs deducted)
   ```

3. **Monthly Property Taxes**:
   ```
   Annual Property Tax ÷ 12
   ```

4. **Monthly Insurance** (estimate):
   ```
   ~$250/month (adjust based on property value/coverage)
   ```

5. **Monthly HOA** (if applicable):
   ```
   Use actual HOA fee from listing
   ```

6. **Total Monthly Housing Cost (PITI + HOA)**:
   ```
   P&I + Taxes + Insurance + HOA = Total Monthly
   ```

#### Example Calculation:

**Property**: Jacaranda Ct, $1,195,000
- List Price: $1,195,000
- Total Budget: $696,000
- Closing Costs: ~$12,000
- **Net Downpayment**: $696,000 - $12,000 = $684,000
- **Mortgage Amount**: $1,195,000 - $684,000 = $511,000
- **P&I**: $3,398/mo @ 7%, 30yr on $511K mortgage
- **Taxes**: $639/mo
- **Insurance**: $250/mo
- **HOA**: $570/mo
- **TOTAL MONTHLY**: $4,857/mo

### Affordability Analysis

**For Primary Residence**:
- **The specified budget covers ALL costs** - closing, fees, and downpayment
- Deduct closing costs FIRST, remainder goes to downpayment
- Calculate mortgage on the NET downpayment amount
- **Arizona Move Threshold**: Monthly PITI ≤ $7,000 (comfortable budget)
- Verify home meets all requirements (lot size, casita, garage, pool, etc.)
- Focus on: Monthly affordability + Requirements match
- **Key principle**: If property fits within budget after closing costs AND monthly ≤ $7K, property is AFFORDABLE

### Requirements Checklist

Each property must be evaluated against:

1. **Lot Size**: Minimum 0.5 acres for observatory (critical requirement)
2. **Casita**: Guest house/separate living space required
3. **Garage**: Prefer 4-car, minimum 2-car with RV parking
4. **Pool**: Heated pool preferred
5. **Bedrooms**: 4+ bedrooms
6. **Bathrooms**: 4+ bathrooms
7. **Location**: Proximity to Phoenix (30-45 min acceptable)
8. **HOA**: Prefer no HOA or minimal HOA
9. **Horses**: Horse-friendly property preferred
10. **Views**: Mountain/desert views preferred

### Scoring System

- **95-100**: MUST SEE - Top priority
- **90-94**: EXCELLENT - Strong contender
- **85-89**: VERY GOOD - Good backup
- **80-84**: GOOD - Consider if limited options
- **Below 80**: PASS unless unique circumstances

## 🏢 RENTAL INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

### Financial Analysis Rules

**CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT downpayment amount specified by user. Standard is 25% down for investment properties.

#### Given Information:
- **Downpayment**: 25% of purchase price (standard for investment)
- **Interest Rate**: 7% (current market rate)
- **Loan Term**: 30 years fixed

#### Calculation Steps:

1. **Downpayment Amount**:
   ```
   Down = Purchase Price × 25%
   ```

2. **Remaining Mortgage**:
   ```
   Mortgage = Purchase Price - Downpayment
   ```

3. **Monthly Principal & Interest (P&I)**:
   ```
   Use 7% interest rate, 30-year term
   Calculate on remaining mortgage amount
   ```

4. **Monthly Property Taxes**:
   ```
   Annual Property Tax ÷ 12
   ```

5. **Monthly Insurance**:
   ```
   Use actual or estimate ~$150-200/month
   ```

6. **Monthly HOA** (if applicable):
   ```
   Use actual HOA fee from listing
   ```

7. **Total PITI + HOA**:
   ```
   P&I + Taxes + Insurance + HOA
   ```

8. **Property Management** (10% of rent):
   ```
   Estimated Rent × 10%
   ```

9. **Total Monthly Expenses**:
   ```
   PITI + HOA + Property Management
   ```

10. **Monthly Cash Flow**:
    ```
    Estimated Rent - Total Monthly Expenses
    ```

#### Example Calculation:

**Property**: Mesa Orion St, $538,000, Rent $3,500/mo
- Purchase Price: $538,000
- Downpayment (25%): $134,500
- **Remaining Mortgage**: $403,500
- **P&I**: $3,268/mo @ 7%, 30yr
- **Taxes**: $447/mo
- **Insurance**: $150/mo
- **HOA**: $155/mo
- **Property Mgmt**: $350/mo (10%)
- **TOTAL EXPENSES**: $4,370/mo
- **Rent**: $3,500/mo
- **MONTHLY CASH FLOW**: -$870 (NEGATIVE)

### Investment Criteria

**PASS Criteria**:
- Break even monthly cash flow (rent ≥ expenses) for both LTR and STR

- Cap rate > 5% (good indicator)
- Good neighborhood/appreciation potential

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Negative monthly cash flow

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

### DO:
- ✅ Use EXACT downpayment amount specified
- ✅ Calculate remaining mortgage correctly
- ✅ Use 7% interest rate for current market
- ✅ Include ALL monthly costs (PITI + HOA + PM for rentals)
- ✅ Focus on whether property meets requirements
- ✅ Use 2-column table format for compression
- ✅ Add property photos after title
- ✅ Remove unnecessary horizontal rule breaks

### DON'T:
- ❌ Calculate alternative downpayment percentages (20%, 40%, etc.)
- ❌ Show "cash remaining" for primary residence (not relevant)
- ❌ Estimate downpayment - use exact amount given
- ❌ Forget to include HOA in monthly costs
- ❌ Use verbose formatting with excessive breaks

## 📐 MORTGAGE CALCULATION FORMULA

**Monthly Payment Formula**:
```
M = P [ r(1+r)^n ] / [ (1+r)^n - 1 ]

Where:
M = Monthly payment
P = Principal (loan amount)
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)
n = Number of payments (years × 12)

Example: $499,000 @ 7% for 30 years
r = 0.07 ÷ 12 = 0.005833
n = 30 × 12 = 360
M = $3,318/month
```

**Quick Reference for 7%, 30-year loans**:
- $100,000 = $665/mo
- $200,000 = $1,331/mo
- $300,000 = $1,996/mo
- $400,000 = $2,661/mo
- $500,000 = $3,327/mo
- $600,000 = $3,992/mo
- $700,000 = $4,657/mo
- $800,000 = $5,322/mo
